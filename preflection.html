                “We used Laura to handle all the day of coordination (and month leading up to!). I cannot say enough amazing things about their team. Laura and team were onsite for the rehearsal, which ran smoother than ANY rehearsal I've ever been a part of. Two times quickly through, and we were done! They even went out of their way to make sure all personal items that we wanted to incorporate into the actual wedding/reception were safely in their possession so we had one less thing to worry about the next day. They kept everything flowing smoothly on the big day, made sure all vendors knew their places, worked with the venue's event team, etc. Their diligence and extreme attention to detail allowed us to focus on enjoying our wedding day and nothing else, knowing that every little detail would be taken care of -- it's hard to overstate the amount of worry and stress they alleviated by being there with us, running the show, keeping everything on track and freeing us up to truly immerse ourselves in the joy of our special day. I cannot thank them enough -- they were professional, easy to communicate with, and above all so incredibly nice! Thank you Laura, Samantha, and Morgan! You truly made our wedding and wedding weekend a dream.”

                Ellen made my wedding day so much more wonderful. We hired Ellen as the Day-of Coordinator, but in reality she was involved in helping us pull everything together the entire month before. She worked tirelessly to make sure the day-of was executed flawlessly and went above and beyond every expectation. Both my husband and mother commented that we wouldn't have been able to do it without her! She managed all vendors to make sure that everyone knew exactly what to do and where to go. She created an incredibly detailed day-of timeline that had every single event planned. She was a great resource for other wedding details which needed to be decided and finalized before the big day. She was essential in the planning process and made sure that as we got closer to our wedding day we wouldn’t be running around to get things in order. She was always available to talk either via email/text/phone. What was great is she always took the initiative to complete the next task for our wedding. I never had to approach her to make sure something was getting done because she was already on it. As we got closer to our wedding day, she was great at communicating with all of our vendors to make sure they had all of the necessary information. Our wedding day ran smoothly all thanks to Ellen. I didn’t have to worry about a thing during our wedding. If you are hesitant on hiring a day of coordinator, don't be! It is, without a doubt, the best money I spent for the whole wedding!"

          			“Ellen was our day of coordinator and had Laura working alongside her. Early in our wedding planning we were unsure if we needed a day of coordinator, looking back I couldn’t imagine our day without Ellen + Laura. From the very beginning Ellen was incredibly helpful and gave us tons of good advice leading up to the big day. Her organization and knowledge are worth every penny and then some. Ellen ran our rehearsal, which was incredibly smooth. But, the real magic was on our wedding day. Ellen + Laura did so much – the largest tasks to the smallest details were all executed flawlessly. I could go on and on about details of our experience, but I will share just one example of what you can expect from these guys: Our wedding was on the roof of the Atlanta Metro Chamber, which is open air and overlooks Centennial Park. To our surprise there was a 5k starting and ending in the park on our wedding day, complete with loud music. As we were taking pictures in the park before the wedding, we see Laura + Ellen dashing across the street. Knowing that the music may interfere with our ceremony, they went over to talk to the DJ for the event and asked them to turn down the music just for the duration of our ceremony, which they did! Working with Ellen + Laura was truly an exceptional experience. These professionals made our wedding completely perfect.”

She made sure the up-lighting was the correct colors and that the favors were given out and just little things that really made the night special. Would absolutely suggest to anyone to hire her as a Day-Of Coordinator - with out her, I don't think things would've run as smoothly.

If you don't have a day-of coordinator, IT IS THE BEST MONEY YOU WILL SPEND PLANNING YOUR WEDDING!! Seriously. Laura has such a straightforward approach and will give you her honest opinion,
which I loved. There was no task too large or too small for her. She was a great resource for all of the critical decisions like helping plan my day-of timeline, helping me configure the layout of the reception, providing input on vendors, etc. but also was happy to do small things like a Starbucks run for the bridesmaids!! One thing my mom loved is that she helped pack up all of the bridal suite, favors, decorations, etc. at the end of the night. I love the way she ran our rehearsal the day before as well...many people commented that it was the easiest rehearsal they had ever done. Really can't say enough good things!!!!”

During our planning process, we were about 6 weeks out and didn’t have a wedding planner — It was suggested that Laura Burchfield contact us and that was the best decision we ever made. We hired her on as a day of wedding coordinator and it was just about the best money we spent on the entire wedding. In addition to coordinating our timeline of events, coordinating transportation, and getting things ready for the day, she handled a few items that unexpectedly came up the day of so that we didn’t have to – and that was HUGE. We were highly satisfied with her services.!!!”

          		“My daughter was married at Barnsley Gardens on April 11, 2015. When I first contacted Lethal Rhythms, I was looking for a DJ. We ended up using the DJ, the Photo Booth and best of all Laura Burchfield and Samantha Claybrook as Planners and same day coordinators. With a
venue like Barnsley, I was overwhelmed by the idea of acting as host and mother of the bride in different locations on the property and coordinating the florist, photographer, videographer, bakery, and DJ. If the event planners had been on board from the beginning of the planning,
my job would have been much easier. I thought that the cost was unnecessary, and since my other daughter was married just 6 months ago, it would be easy to cover all of the vendors and the venue. Laura and Samantha took over and managed the day and let me enjoy the wedding. It was the best money we spent on the entire wedding. They handled everything from party favors to gatecrashers with grace and efficiency. DJ Fernando was very good at keeping things moving, the photo booth was fun, but Samantha and Morgan stole the show for me the day of the wedding.”
