Thanks for being so great to work with. I know it must have been great for the bride and groom but it was great for me to not to have to worry about so many of the details and focus on my part of the day."

"As an officiant I have to work with a lot of different couples without a wedding planner. If you are going to have a big wedding you need a great planner & Laura Burchfield is a great one. I found her extremely easy to work with but she knew exactly what she was doing and she did it well. I would work with Laura at any opportunity I could."

If you don't have a day-of coordinator, IT IS THE BEST MONEY YOU WILL SPEND PLANNING YOUR WEDDING!! Seriously. Laura has such a straightforward approach and will give you her honest opinion, which I loved. There was no task too large or too small for her. She was a great resource for all of the critical decisions like helping plan my day-of timeline, helping me configure the layout of the reception, providing input on vendors, etc. but also was happy to do small things like a Starbucks run for the bridesmaids!! One thing my mom loved is that she helped pack up all of the bridal suite, favors, decorations, etc. at the end of the night. I love the way she ran our rehearsal the day before as well...many people commented that it was the easiest rehearsal they had ever done. Really can't say enough good things!!!!”
